# Movie Recommendation System using Python

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built with Python.  
It suggests movies that are similar to a selected title using **content-based filtering** techniques such as **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to recommend movies based on their **genres** and **content similarity**.  
This is one of the most common applications of Machine Learning in real-world platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and IMDb.

The system analyzes relationships between movies and provides recommendations that are most similar to the one chosen by the user.
